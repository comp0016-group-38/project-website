In the past two weeks, our team has been working diligently on developing a new MFC app, and we are pleased to report that we’ve made some significant progress. We started by working on the design of the app, and we’ve already completed the first draft.

We also took some time out to attend a trip to Northampton, where we had the opportunity to meet with VR therapies. It was an excellent opportunity for us to take close look how people enjoy from VR therapies and the meaning of our work.

In the meeting with VR therapies, we discussed about mirror gestures and spasm contractions, and understand how they can impact the user experience. We also learned that spasm movements must need to be smooth to ensure that they don’t ruin the user's experience.

Moreover, we focused on developing our game, and during this period, we worked on several features, including the pause menu and setting menu (music volume setting). We finally integrate music into it and make it adjustable.

We look forward to sharing more updates in the coming weeks.
