In the last two weeks, our team has been busy with various tasks related to our project. We met with the client again to discuss the progress and update them on our plans. 

One of the major accomplishments was making the Forcefield and Wrist Tracking Gesture finally work properly in Mediapipe. Then, we wanted to integrate this navigation technology into the Minecraft game and other games to make it more interactive and engaging.

We also tried to move the Mediapipe code to MotionInput and updated the website. Additionally, we prepared for the upcoming presentation and worked on the key mappings to ensure smooth functioning of the technology.

Overall, the last two weeks have been extremely productive, and we are on track to deliver high-quality results for our client.
