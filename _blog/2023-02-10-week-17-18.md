In the last 2 weeks, our team has been busy making progress on MFC, MotionInput and games. For MFC, we finally get our window laptop and have set up our laptops, installed C++ Visual Studio, and installed individual components such as C++ MFC x86 x64 and C++ 16.11 MFC x86 x64. We have also created an executable file in the root folder, and obtained data from JSON files from MotionInput. 

In MFC-UCL-MI3-Settings, we made progress on the main file to change to **`.rc`**.

In MotionInput, we focused on developing gestures. 

For the game, our team is collaborating on GitHub for the Unity project. We made a list of assets we required from the Unity store from tones of assets and send 3 assets to our department.

We also designed the scene selection menu and worked on scene switching buttons to enable users to switch between scenes.

Additionally, we added an audio menu and settings menu, implemented scene switching, and settings volume mixer.

Since we havenâ€™t got the asset to start developing the actual game, we are using Unity primitive objects to move an object based on a keypress. 

We're excited to continue working together and bringing our project to life!
