In these two weeks, we have had meetings with our client, and she suggested us to develop more gestures, like  hand-raising to call all animals, hand-shooing to make them go away, and even added a hug gesture to show affection towards our animal friends. However, given that our users suffer from hand contracture, it is more practical to go in the direction of our current development. We intend to further upgrade gesture once we have completed the content we currently need. Additionally, as for game design, she suggested that we can have bright colors, high contrasts, and low-poly graphics to create a friendly environment and make the game to be visually appealing and fun for all ages.

On top of that, we also made progress towards developing a punch gesture suit for  punching game. This entailed creating a soft and a hard punch motion for both hands for the game.

We also had a presentation and demo towards 20-25 guests from microsoft, intel, etc. We have done great and all the demo works properly in the presentation.

Moreover, our elevator pitch was also a significant part of the past two weeks. We focused on creating an engaging story-telling approach, a demo GIF, and highlighting the unique features of our game.

In terms of game development, we firstly tackled how to share Unity code, whether to use Unity collaboration or GitHub.

However, we did face some setbacks regarding MotionInput. Our camera did not work well with this, which led to some delays in our progress.

Overall, we have accomplished a lot in the past two weeks and are excited to continue working on our project.
