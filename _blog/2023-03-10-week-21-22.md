In the last two weeks, our team has been making really big progress on a project. 

We finally got the assets and since we donâ€™t have much time left, therefore, we quickly get into the game development phase. Basically we create the 4 scenes and try to add animals agent into the scenes, making some effect and write script.

We have also created an animator controller script to ensure that the animal actions are executed correctly. Key inputs match the action, and the animals perform random actions when there is no key input. But we encounter some challenges like to create both land and marine animals together in 1 scene, the animals walking but not changing position and not facing the camera when moving towards it. We also ran into some problems with the navMesh agent getting stuck in the scene at certain points. However, we discovered that simplifying the map and reducing its complexity could fix this problem.

Another main focus has been on refining the MotionInput gestures and implementing additional features to improve the user experience. Our team also had a meeting with the Prof. Dean, which was a great opportunity to get feedback and guidance on the project. We discussed our progress so far and received valuable insights on how to improve it. Talking about MotionInput, we have made significant progress with this feature. The wrist tracking is now working, and we just need to add smoothing to it. We are using laplacian and tablet driver to achieve the desired results. By using chunks instead of rolling average, we were able to increase the buffer size to 10. This has helped eliminate spasms and improve the smoothness of the gestures. We have also added a forcefield click and contractures mode.

Additionally, we have made progress with MFC for 2 modes, with the edited version being particularly successful.

In summary, we have made tremendous progress in the past two weeks, refining the MotionInput gestures and implementing additional features. We are looking forward to delivering a polished product that will provide a unique and immersive gaming experience to our users.
