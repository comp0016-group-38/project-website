In the last two weeks, we have been busy preparing for our upcoming Literature Review presentation. Our team members have been reviewing various similar games such as ABZU, Kinectimals, Nature Treks VR, and Ocean Rift to gather information about game descriptions, mechanisms, main features, key mapping, differences, and what we can learn from them. Additionally, we have been collecting ideas based on similar games to help us develop a unique and engaging game. We have also been researching which tools would be suitable to bring our vision to reality and how we can connect gestures with our game mechanics. We are excited about the progress we have made and looks forward to sharing our findings and ideas.

Here is the link to have a look at our Literature Review :
