In the past two weeks, our team has been busy with a lot of work related to Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Firstly, we have been preparing for our HCI presentation slide, making sure that we cover all aspects of our project.

This includes gathering requirements as we aim to create a game that meets our users' needs.

Creating sketches as it helps us visualize the game's layout and design.

Making personas and scenarios to help us understand our users better and create a personalized experience for them.

We also explained our interaction techniques in the slide. This includes forcefield and wrist tracking, to make gaming more immersive for our users. We have discussed how it will look like, what setup is needed, and how it will work in our game.

We have also evaluated the prototype and are confident that the result will produce an excellent gaming experience for our users.

At the end of this two weeks, we finally met our client Rebecca together with team 39 to have a further understanding about what we going to do and the purpose of doing it.
