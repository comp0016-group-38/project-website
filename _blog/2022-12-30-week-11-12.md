In the last two weeks, our team has been working hard to create an efficient ‘Requirement’ page content. We have done an extensive research on project background, and partner Intro to ensure that we are able to deliver the best solutions. Moreover, We have been focusing on presenting clear and concise project goals to achieve maximum impact. Additionally, we have finalized the HCI presentation content to be up to date with the requirements. We have also worked on developing use cases and identified functional and non-functional requirements in Must-haves, Should-haves, Could-haves and Won't-haves (MoSCoW) format. Our team has also created an insightful monthly video for December, and continue developing gestures using Mediapipe.
