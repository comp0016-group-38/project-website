In the past two weeks, our team are towards our goal of creating an innovative device to help people with cerebral palsy navigate digital interfaces. One of the key achievements was the initiation of wrist tracking for wrist contractions using MediaPipe. We have managed to develop a gesture demo that involved manipulating a small dot on the screen, using wrist tracking to move the dot around.

And the forcefields gesture demo is shown by changing the color of the dot when the depth changes.

To make the technology more user-friendly and reduce the effect of spasms, we've been busy organizing meetings with other member to brainstorm ways of reducing noise in the prototype and conducting literature reviews. Additionally, we're contemplating integrating music into our games.

A regular weekly meeting with client(Rebecca) and group 39 has also been established to ensure that feedback is continually processed, and any additional requirements or notices we need to considered. 

We also made efforts to create a development plan(Gantt charts) and website establishment.

Some of us have also watched the Unity Tutorial to acquaint themselves with the platform's best practices.

In conclusion, the MotionInput team has made significant progress in the past two weeks and seems to be on track to develop an innovative technology that will aid individuals with cerebral palsy. We can't wait to see what they come up with next!
