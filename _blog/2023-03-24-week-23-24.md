In the final two weeks, our team are finalizing our project. 

In the first week, we had an exciting opportunity to deliver our Playstation presentation, where we showcased our innovative and interactive features. We demonstrated the our browser navigation using wrist tracking and forcefield click, with spasm reduction and hand jitter capabilities. Additionally, we presented the boxing game with forcefield modes that facilitated hard and soft punches. Lastly, we showed the Atari breakout game with wrist tracking.

The feedback received from the presentation was positive. The audience expressed their enjoyment and believed that our project would change people's lives. Some crucial feedback we received included the importance of calibration and only counting forward movements, not backward ones. 

We also focused on finalizing unity game's interaction with an animal coming towards the camera correctly these 2 weeks. Moreover, we modified the UI design with a better background and more decent button design.

We also put a considerable amount of time into the MFC app development, everything apart from the level buttons was worked upon in the first week. 

Moving forward to the last week, we are continuing to work on finalizing the MFC app by adding speech recognition capabilities alongside making navigation work for a wide range of games. we finally managed to make it into an executable file and transfer the data set in MFC to MotionInput. 

Alongside this, we worked on motioninput and made considerable improvements such as combining forcefield modes wrist tracking to perform mouse actions , i.e. cursor travel around and click to make it more configurable. 

On Tuesday, we also presented our demo to Dr David Reeves, the former CEO of PlayStation (PS1, PS2, PS3, Namco, Capcom and Konami leads). 

We are also working on finalizing the four scenes and making all the motion inputs, MFC app, and unity games into executable files.

Since we don’t have much time left, we sent the demo to our client and request feedback on the final product. The feedback is positive and it helped us to fine-tune and make adjustments before the final launch. 

We also have finalized the website and put considerable time and effort into making every detail completed . 

We are thrilled and excited about the progress of our project and the outcome thus far. Each week brings us closer to the final launch, and we look forward to continuing our hard work and dedication to this project. Throughout this process, we are so glad that we have the opportunity to contact the client and understand the real world needs and work together to make technology really helpful to even a small group of people, but bringing a really significant impact to them. We also gain a basic insight about the development structure and techniques by collaboratively working it out from zero to ‘hero’!
