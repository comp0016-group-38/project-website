For these two weeks, we have made significant progress towards applying forcefield interaction using media pipe code. We had a productive meeting with Alex to discuss hand pose or body pose works better, how forcefield is measured in depth, and get rid of the problem of jitter. To address the issue of jitter, we explored the concept of rolling average.

We also worked on implementing wrist tracking using media pipe to improve its accuracy. Additionally, we made progress in improving the sketch for the Unity game to ensure it is optimized and user-friendly.

Overall, we are happy with the progress we have made so far and look forward to continuing to develop this exciting technology.
