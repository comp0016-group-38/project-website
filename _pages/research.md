## Technology Review

### Ideas Implementation

- **Navigation Development:**
    - Use wrist tracking and punching that suit for people with special needs to navigate Nature Adventure (our game).
    - Implement it using MotionInput as only a camera is needed for technical support.
    - Navigation can be used in wide range of games to replace mouse click and key press.
    - Noise reduction is implemented to reduce the effect of spasm.
- **Game Development:**
    - Make 4 different scenes (underwater, forest, snowy mountain, beach)
    - Use low-poly element throughout the game to make the animals become less terrifying for children.
    - Use of vibrant colors and stunning graphics assets to build scenes.
    - Develop the scene with background effect and music to make the game more immersive for users
    - Apply gravity to animals’ movement and assign random actions by default to make it more realistic
    - Feature sound recognition, allowing use of hot keys
    - Develop different levels of realistic interaction with animals

### Development Tool and Programing Language

- **Navigation Development:**
    - MotionInput (gesture):
        - Developed by UCL in partnership with Microsoft, Intel, IBM and etc.
        - Allows users to interact with their devices without using touch
        - Can interact with games/apps just using gestures: Facial navigation, hand movement, body movement, etc.
        
        ![Screen Shot 2023-03-21 at 12.24.19 AM.png]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images//Screen_Shot_2023-03-21_at_12.24.19_AM.png)
        
    
    - MFC App (settings):
        
        ![Untitled]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images//Untitled.png)
        
        - Device: Visual Studio
        - Language: C++
        
- **Game Development:**

|  | Unity ( √ ) | Unreal Engine |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pros | -  Uses C# 
-  Easy to start with 
-  Faster to prototype 
-  Good documentation 
-  Better suited for mobile games | -  Uses C++
-  Quicker to achieve better visuals
-  Better rendering
-  Better animation
-  Better suits PC and console games    
-  Available blueprints are powerful for game designers
-  All engine code is open-source |
| Cons | -  Take time to make the visuals right 
-  Might have to buy some packages | -  Steep learning curve
-  C++ is less forgiving than C# |

### Algorithm in Development

- Please compare the possible algorithms (if applicable), describe what you choose, and explain why.
- Forcefields gesture
    - Palm height
        - Might not work well if the hand is rotating
    - Distance between other landmarks
        - Hard to choose landmarks that will work for all cases, for all angles of the hand
    - Depth z value
        - Seems to work well
        - Pinky base, pinky tip

### Summary

The wrist tracking and punching navigation with noise reduction are going to develop via MotionInput and calibrate via MFC app to provide people alternatives to navigate wide range of games. The game will be developed using Unity which includes four different scenes, animal interactions, low-poly elements, background effects, and music to create an immersive experience.
