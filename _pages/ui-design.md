The game interface is bright and colorful as it is targeted towards children. The assets we used for the terrain are low poly to be better suited to children.

## MFC

### Design Principles

- Simplicity
- Feedback

Designed in figma

Lots of iteration and trial/error, improving from feedback

Simple, intuitive, had to make it concise and contain the least info needed for functionality.

Don't want to make it complex for the user
